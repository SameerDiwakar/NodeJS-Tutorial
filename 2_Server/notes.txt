The simple json package was created by npm init command in terminal which took 
basic information of server.

Secondly we changed directory by cd 'dirname' and installed express package by npm
using command npm i express. We can clear terminal by writing clear.

We also installed nodemon by npm i nodemon to track the changes in program
It helps use not to run program again and again
